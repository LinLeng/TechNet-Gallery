## Description
The script Get-Sessions gets information about interactive logins to a system (including RDP sessions).

If no further parameters are specified, the local system is examined and the logins of the last week are displayed in short format. An attempt is made to logically summarize the times of logon sessions, this means for a new connection after a disconnect a new output line is displayed.

If parameter -Detailed is specified, the output will be expanded with session id and name or IP of the remote host.

Based upon the script Get-ULogged.ps1 from [VGSandz](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Find-Users-who-Logged-in-07dbe5f6).

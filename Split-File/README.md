Since Technet Gallery is closed, now here.

See Script Center version: [Powershell functions to split and join binary files fast](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Powershell-functions-to-cb6bb05a).

Now also on Powershell Gallery as part of the **SysAdminsFriends** module, see [here](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SysAdminsFriends/) or install with
```powershell
Install-Module SysAdminsFriends
```

Project page on github is [here](https://github.com/MScholtes/SysAdminsFriends).

## Description
Two Powershell functions to split and join binary files fast. The functions are using .Net BinaryWriter methods.

If .Net 4 or above is detected, the quick .CopyTo() method is used to join files.

## Update
2020-05-03: Split-File can chunk into parts of size > 2GB now

## Usage
in the following examples I assume all files are in the current directory

Dot source the functions first:
```powershell
. .\Split-File.ps1
```
You can then split a file BigFile.dat with
```powershell
Split-File "BigFile.dat" 10000000
```
into parts of 10000000 byte size or to parts of the default size of 100 MB with
```powershell
Split-File "BigFile.dat"
```
The generated part files are named BigFile01.dat, BigFile02.dat, BigFile03.dat ...

You can join the part files BigFile01.dat, BigFile02.dat, BigFile03.dat ... to the original file e.g. with
```powershell
dir BigFile??.dat | Join-File Rebuild.dat
```
Rebuild.dat is the same file as the original BigFile.dat.

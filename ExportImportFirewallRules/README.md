## Description
There is only one possibility to export and import firewall rules: as a blob (wfw file) in the firewall console or with a script. If you want to automate removing or editing a rule from the set there is no (easy) way to do it without using a third party tool or messing with the registry in dangerous places.

The three scripts *ExportFirewallRules.ps1*, *ImportFirewallRules.ps1* and *RemoveFirewallRules.ps1* export, import and remove complete firewall rule sets in CSV or JSON file format. When importing existing rules with the same display name will be overwritten.

Requires Windows 8.1 / Server 2012 R2 or above.

## List of scripts:
```powershell
Export-FirewallRules.ps1 [[-Name] <Object>] [[-CSVFile] <Object>] [-JSON] [-PolicyStore <String>] [-Inbound] [-Outbound] [-Enabled] [-Disabled] [-Allow] [-Block]
```
Exports firewall rules to a CSV or JSON file.
```
-Name
Display name of the rules to be processed. Wildcard character * is allowed. Default: *
-CSVFile
Output file. Default: .\Firewall.csv
-JSON
Output in JSON instead of CSV format. Default: $FALSE
-PolicyStore
Store from which the rules are retrieved (default: ActiveStore).
Allowed values are PersistentStore, ActiveStore (the resultant rule set of all sources), localhost, a computer name, <domain.fqdn.com>\<GPO_Friendly_Name>, RSOP and others depending on the environment.
-Inbound -Outbound -Enabled -Disabled -Allow -Block
Filter which rules to export
```

```powershell
Import-FirewallRules.ps1 [[-CSVFile] <Object>] [-JSON] [-PolicyStore <String>]
```
Imports firewall rules from a CSV or JSON file.
```
-CSVFile
Input file. Default: .\Firewall.csv
-JSON
Input in JSON instead of CSV format. Default: $FALSE
-PolicyStore
Store to which the rules are written (default: PersistentStore).
Allowed values are PersistentStore, ActiveStore (the resultant rule set of all sources), localhost, a computer name, <domain.fqdn.com>\<GPO_Friendly_Name> and others depending on the environment.
```

```powershell
Remove-FirewallRules.ps1 [[-CSVFile] <Object>] [-JSON] [-PolicyStore <String>]
```
Remove firewall rules according to the list in a CSV or JSON file.
```
-CSVFile
Input file. Default: .\Firewall.csv
-JSON
Input in JSON instead of CSV format. Default: $FALSE
-PolicyStore
Store from which rules are removed (default: PersistentStore).
Allowed values are PersistentStore, ActiveStore (the resultant rule set of all sources), localhost, a computer name, <domain.fqdn.com>\<GPO_Friendly_Name> and others depending on the environment.
```

## Examples
assume the scripts are in the current directory, modify path to scripts if not

Export all firewall rules to the CSV file FirewallRules.csv in the current directory:
```powershell
.\Export-FirewallRules.ps1
```

Export all SNMP firewall rules to the JSON file SNMPRules.json:
```powershell
.\Export-FirewallRules.ps1 snmp* SNMPRules.json -json
```

Import all firewall rules in the CSV file FirewallRules.csv in the current directory:
```powershell
.\Import-FirewallRules.ps1
```

Imports all firewall rules in the JSON file WmiRules.json:
```powershell
.\Import-FirewallRules.ps1 WmiRules.json -json
```

## Remarks
There might be issues when importing rules for "metro apps" to another computer.

App packet rules are stored as a SID and usually apply only to user accounts whose SIDs are stored in the export file. Those rules will not work on another computer since a SID is unique.
